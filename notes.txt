Some notes of things I want to do to make this package better 

1. Add multiple selections to the Rss widget so that I can also add spires.

2. Need ability to parse spires. Parser Base Class and then piping for
each type? This would make it easy to extend this to a plugin in
framework so that anyone could write a parser for any page.

3. Exception handling needs to be added.

4. Doxygen documentation comments need to be added.
